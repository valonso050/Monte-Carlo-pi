# Monte-Carlo $Ï€$
This repository idea came from a project that was proposed to me in one of my programming classes at uni. I thought it was quite original and simple enough, so I decided to create this mini tutorial that goes over some of the math and explains how to create a simple simulation in python, via Jupyter notebooks.

I hope you like it as much as I enjoyed making it, I myself also learn a lot from doing these!
